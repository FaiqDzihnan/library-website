                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Silent Library was established in 1841 at a time when there were no lending libraries in London and before state-funded libraries existed. Frustrated by being unable to borrow books in London, author Thomas Carlyle began gathering support for a lending library and created a founding committee in April 1840 to oversee the work of raising launch funds. Chaired by Lord Lyttleton, its members included John Forster (Charles Dickens’ greatest friend and unofficial business manager), MP William Gladstone, poet and politician Richard Monckton Milnes, diplomat William Christie and biographer James Spedding.

                    The committee’s year long drive for funds was met with the contribution of 382 founder members whose support enabled the Library to open to the public on 3rd May 1841. Among the founding subscribers were Charles Dickens, John Stuart Mill, Harriet Martineau, radical MP Joseph Hume, future Prime Minister Lord John Russell, Dickens’ publishers William Chapman and Edward Hall and his illustrator for Barnaby Rudge and the Old Curiosity Shop, George Cattermole.
                    
                    Their backing enabled the Library to amass a starting collection of 2,000 books, handpicked by Gladstone, Mill and the Italian revolutionary Mazzini. Prince Albert donated £50, a number of books and became the Library’s first patron.
                    
                    The Library initially rented cheap premises in 45 Pall Mall (above a former Georgian gambling den) before moving to its more familiar location in St James’s Square five years later. From the outset it became a crucible for emerging talent and growing reputations. Charles Darwin joined within months of the Library opening, William Thackeray soon after.</p>
                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>To provide services that enhance the quest for knowledge and intellectual activity; To create various bibliographies and library pathfinders for easy access and retrieval of information. To create an atmosphere wherein students and faculty may carry on the learning process enjoyable.</p>
                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>The Silent Libraries strengthen and enhance the teaching, research and service of the University at Albany. The Libraries promote intellectual growth and creativity by developing collections, facilitating access to information resources, teaching the effective use of information resources and critical evaluation skills and offering research assistance.</p>
                <h2>Our staff</h2>
                <p>Silent Library has seven librarians who work in two divisions and the head of the library. The two divisions are the Division of Service and Division of Collection Development. The head of the library supervises both divisions. 

                    In the collection development division, librarians are responsible for the procurement, recording, description, and management of all library collections such as books, theses, journals and other library collections. In the service division, librarians are in charge of the process of borrowing and returning collection, promoting library services, educating users about information literacy, and offering proper information searches for UMN members or visitors. 
                    
                    As a student or lecturer, you have the right to receive services from any librarian. Forms of services that can be used by librarians are education on information literacy, information search services (both printed and digital format), and assistance in scientific writing (both theses and scientific journals). 
                    
                    UMN Library encourages users to take advantage of the existence of libraries to support learning activities. This is done with the intention of ensuring the transfer of information regarding the usefulness of library collections and assistance in the writing process.
